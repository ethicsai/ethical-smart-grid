"""
This package contains various reward functions, used to compute a
reward signal for each agent, based on their action and the resulting
state of the environment.

Some reward functions are purely numerical, somewhat traditional in the
Reinforcement Learning literature, whereas others are based on more
symbolic reasoning.
