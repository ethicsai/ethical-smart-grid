  This file is used to automatically redirect clients to one of the versions,
  which are actually stored in subdirectories when using sphinx-multiversion.
  (In other words, the root folder contains only the subdirectories for each
  version, no .html file, and especially not the `index.html` landing page.)

  This file MUST be rendered, e.g., as a Jinja2 template, or modified through
  sed, to specify the correct version that we want to redirect to.
  This can be, for example, the latest tag found, or hard-coding the master
  branch. The corresponding folder (that we redirect to) MUST exist.
  Otherwise, the redirection will NOT WORK, and GitHub Pages will show a
  404 error.
